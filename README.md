# Delivery-Cost-Analysis
As a final-year B.Com student, this is my first project in my data analyst career. It’s not too advanced, but I used the tools I’ve learned so far--Excel for basic cleaning, SQL for analysis, and Power BI for reporting used an AI-generated dataset. Motivated and eager to learn and Upskill in the data analytics field.
